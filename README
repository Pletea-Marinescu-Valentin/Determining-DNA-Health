This program takes in input regarding genes and their respective health values, and a set of DNA strands with starting and ending positions, and returns the minimum and maximum health of the DNA strands.

Dependencies:
The program requires the following dependencies:

math
bisect
collections
Usage
To run the program, execute the main.py file using Python. The program takes input from standard input and returns output to standard output.

Input format:
The input format consists of the following:

An integer howGenes representing the number of genes.
A string of howGenes space-separated strings, representing the genes.
A string of howGenes space-separated integers, representing the health values of the corresponding genes.
An integer howStrands representing the number of DNA strands to be tested.
howStrands lines, each containing a space-separated integer first, a space-separated integer last, and a string strand.
Output format
The program returns two space-separated integers, representing the minimum and maximum health of the DNA strands.

Code Overview:
1.Import the necessary libraries.
2.Define a function getHealth to calculate the health of a DNA strand.
3.Read in the input values for howGenes, genes, healths, and howStrands.
4.Create a dictionary gMap that maps genes to a list of indices and their respective health values.
5.Create a set subs of all possible substrings of the genes.
6.Calculate the cumulative health values of each gene in gMap.
7.Calculate the largest length of the genes.
8.Loop over the number of strands and calculate the health of each strand using the getHealth function.
9.Return the minimum and maximum health values of the strands.
